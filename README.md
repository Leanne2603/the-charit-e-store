## What is the purpose of this application?  

The purpose of the Charit-E-Store Application is to promote items in need. For example, when there is a natural disaster, members of the community can be adversely affected and require access to clothes, general household items, matresses, bottled water etc. 

This store allows for a user who is wanting to help out to log on and view an appeal (category) and see what is in need and gives them the option to purchase the item online to be delivered to the area which needs it.

It opens up the opportunity for the customer to be able to donate items across the country and not just in their local area.

## Why is it a problem that needs solving?

When donating items, sometimes there may not be a balance between the items being donated. This means that some items might be in surplus whereas other items are in need.

By creating a website like Charit-E-Store, it allows for a customer to be able to view the items which are actually required at that present time. This includes donations of a monetary value or gift cards for affected residents to use.

An example of how this application could have been beneficial would be the 2019/2020 bushfires. During this crisis, there was an outpoor of generosity from the public donating items to charity. This caused the charities to be overloaded with items which they could not store and had no use for at that time. In some instances, members from the Australian Defence Force were diverted away from more crucial tasks to assist in sorting and removing items and additional funds needed to be allocated to sort and allocate donated items. A website which can assist in providing information and the ability to 'purchase' a donation for what is currently in demand can help alleviate this issue.
During the Victorians bushfires in 2009, an additional 8 million dollars allocated to non-profits to assist in managing the sorting and allocation of goods
